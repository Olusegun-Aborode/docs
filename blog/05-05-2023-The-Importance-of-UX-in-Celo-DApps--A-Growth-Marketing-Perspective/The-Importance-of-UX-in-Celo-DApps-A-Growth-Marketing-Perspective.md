# Introduction

As you must have already known, A Dapp, or decentralized application, is a type of software application that operates on a decentralized network or blockchain platform.

Instead of being controlled by a central authority or server. Dapps are typically built using smart contracts, which are self-executing computer programs that run on a blockchain network.

This decentralised structure of application has completely changed the way Decentralised Finance is approached and utilised. Dapps ultimately it easy for users to interact with Defi.

And when building Dapps on a Blockchain like Celo that’s designed to make it easy for anyone with a smartphone to participate in the decentralized economy. 

## Why dUAWs (Daily Unique Active Wallets) are Important for DApps

There’s an essence for Decentralised Applications to run on Smart contracts and still make it easy for anyone with a smartphone to participate in the decentralized economy.

Hence there’s a demand for Dapps with seamless User Experience. It’s Because Dapps' awesome utility and also with Great UX tend to have huge daily unique Active Wallets (dUAW).

dUAW is a metric used to measure the number of unique wallet addresses that have been used to perform at least one transaction on a Dapp during a 24-hour period. 

With this Metric, we can understand the network activity and user engagement on any Dapp. Why is this essential? 

When a Dapp (i.e. a Bridge built on Celo) you want people to use this Bridge with the faster Network and Security advantages it has. 

Hence you need people to Adopt this solution to scale. Then It’s critical to understand this: Asides from the huge utility of any Dapp, one huge metric that drives the Adoption rate is UX.

Based on Industry research by [Dapp Radar;](https://dappradar.com/blog/blockchain-and-dapp-adoption-report-2022) The Dapp industry experienced a 50% increase in the number of daily Unique Active Wallets (dUAW) in 2022, rising from 1.58 million dUAW in 2021 to 2.37 million last year on average.

And even with this, there’s no denying fact that the state of the Dapp user experience is completely unacceptable. 

This creates a demand for developers who can build user-friendly Dapps, especially on Celo, a blockchain designed to make it easy for anyone to participate in the decentralized economy. 

Developers can build great Dapps on the Celo Blockchain, with cheaper gas fees, faster TXN time etc. 

Still, the lack of a User-Friendly Interface can limit the usability and Adoption of the Dapp; Both for Existing crypto Users and Newbies. Hence the need for good UX in Dapps built on Celo.


## 4 Key UX Issues to Consider When Developing a Dapp on Celo

Crypto Newbies and also Active Crypto Users often find themselves in situations where it's difficult to discern what's happening. 

The lack of proper communication and the absence of smooth basic functions can lead to costly errors and trust is lost when that happens.

When building Dapps on Celo as a developer, a simple rule of thumb is to remember what the blockchain stands for. To make it easy for anyone to participate in the decentralized economy. 

While this should be the core focus. There is also a need to consider some Key Issues that can make the Dapps you build more user-friendly, which improves the dUAW user adoption rate.

The first of them is the CTA Button.


### **Connect Wallet Button**

Do you know what's really important for any dApp? It’s the Connect Wallet button. 

But let's be real, with all the news about scams and hacks in the crypto world, it's no wonder people are feeling a little on edge. 

They don't want to risk accidentally connecting to the wrong dApp and losing all their hard-earned assets. Here's the thing though: 

Most dApps don't do anything to help ease that fear and build trust with their users. 

That's where you come in with the Dapp you are intending to build. We're all about taking the low-hanging fruit and making things better.

So, instead of just letting people worry and stress, let's give them some information that can help them feel safer about connecting. Information like:



* Permissions the dApp will be requesting, 
* A link to the contract audit, and 
* Maybe even some extra social proof.

![Connect Wallet Button](docs\blog\05-05-2023-The-Importance-of-UX-in-Celo-DApps--A-Growth-Marketing-Perspective\Images\4.png)


There could be other things you might want to flex here but you get the idea. Other things:



* Number of people connected right now
* Total value locked (TVL)
* View on Celoscan 
* We will automatically disconnect you after 24hrs of inactivity

When you add this context to the UX of the Connect Wallet Button, people feel more secure using your dApp. They're going to be more likely to stick around and use it even more.


#### **Support All Wallet Modal**

The provision of wallet support is a crucial yet often overlooked feature of dApps. 

While Metamask reigns as the most prevalent wallet for ERC20 tokens and other tokens residing on EVM-compatible chains, there are numerous other options available.

With the list continually expanding. But why is this essential?



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![Support All Wallet Modal](docs\blog\05-05-2023-The-Importance-of-UX-in-Celo-DApps--A-Growth-Marketing-Perspective\Images\5.png)


When a user clicks the Connect Wallet button, a pop-up modal should present all available wallets to them, rather than the standard offering of Metamask, WalletConnect, and Coinbase as seen above.

For optimal usability, it is recommended to customize this modal to cater to your target audience and align with your dApp's aesthetic.

Make sure to incorporate all wallets that support your dApp and provide educational resources to inform users about the different wallet options available. 



<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![Support All Wallet Modal](docs\blog\05-05-2023-The-Importance-of-UX-in-Celo-DApps--A-Growth-Marketing-Perspective\Images\7.png)


Additionally, don't forget to consider the mobile version of your dApp, as it is increasingly becoming the preferred method of accessing dApps for many users.


### **Confirmation screens**

When using banking and finance decentralized apps (dApps) to make transactions, users are typically presented with a confirmation screen that summarizes the details of the transaction and asks for approval. 

However, these screens can be confusing and overwhelming, especially for Newbies who are not familiar with crypto jargon like GWEI and royalties. 

This can lead to users feeling like they are being charged hidden fees. 

To address this issue, dApp developers can make a few tweaks to their confirmation screens on dApps they build on Celo.

For example, developers could include the specific action in the title, prioritize the most important information at the top, and provide additional details below. 

They could also use more human-friendly labels, display the local currency value alongside the crypto value, and use tooltips to explain key concepts. 

The entire idea is basically the User experience. You’d want your dApp to be user-friendly.

Additionally, developers could allow users to subtract fees from the total amount, estimate transaction time based on network congestion, and provide the option to receive a transaction summary via email. 

While some crypto jargon may still be necessary, these tweaks offer an opportunity to educate users on important terms and concepts.

Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![Confirmation Screen](docs\blog\05-05-2023-The-Importance-of-UX-in-Celo-DApps--A-Growth-Marketing-Perspective\Images\8.png)


Generally, confirmation screens serve a wide range of purposes beyond just sending cryptocurrency, and their details should be customized to the specific task at hand.

For example, a confirmation screen may simply require a signature to make a minor change or grant additional permissions within a decentralized application (dApp). 

Overall, the details presented on a confirmation screen should be appropriate and relevant to the specific task being performed.


### **Transaction Status**

In the world of cryptocurrency payments, the speed of transaction completion is crucial. 

Unfortunately, this can be a frustrating experience for users due to the varying transaction status screens of different decentralized applications (dApps). 

Some dApps utilize third-party custodial services like [Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/), which do not provide detailed transaction data through their API. 

This means that users are left with a basic transaction status, which does not update automatically, forcing them to refresh the page to check for any changes. 

This lack of transparency is unacceptable, especially since dApps do not typically offer help desks for users to seek assistance.

However, there are solutions to this problem. One notable work on this was done by BitPay, which developed an open-source monitoring client that relays all transaction data through a webhook.



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![Transaction Status](docs\blog\05-05-2023-The-Importance-of-UX-in-Celo-DApps--A-Growth-Marketing-Perspective\Images\9.png)


And this can be implemented even by dApps that use third-party custody services, like Fireblocks. 

It is crucial for dApps to prioritize improving their transaction status screens to provide users with a detailed understanding of what is happening with their transactions. This information should include 



* dynamic status updates, 
* An indication that the transaction is in progress, 
* An estimated time of completion, 
* The number of confirmations, 
* Information on how to speed up or cancel the transaction, 
* An emergency cancel button, and a link to the transaction on a block explorer.

dApps need to ensure that their transaction status screens are transparent and informative to avoid causing unnecessary stress and concern for their users.


### **Disconnecting**

In a recent cyber attack on OpenSea users, an exploiter created a malicious website and sent out a fake email, disguised as an official OpenSea email regarding a contract migration. 

This led NFT influencers to share threads on how to disconnect wallets from OpenSea and revoke token approvals, to mitigate potential risks. 

Some people went as far as suggesting creating new wallets and transferring all assets, but luckily, the extent of the damage was not as severe as initially feared. 



<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image7.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert8">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![Disconnecting](docs\blog\05-05-2023-The-Importance-of-UX-in-Celo-DApps--A-Growth-Marketing-Perspective\Images\6.png)


However, this event highlights the importance of security and the need for a disconnect button to be a standard feature for all dApps especially on Celo.

This would empower users to revoke access to their data immediately or after a specified period of time.

As more data becomes tied to blockchains and more dApps are built, easily disconnecting from these platforms represents a core ideological tenant of Web3, which will grow the amount of data on the chain and power the next wave of the internet. 

Trust in the system is paramount, and there is much work to be done to ensure it.

While these 4 key UX issues, when fixed by developers to improve the user experience on dApps built on Celo. It’s rather necessary to see how this applies in a Growth Marketing Setting.


## Growth Marketing Perspective of UX in dApps on Celo

Growth marketing is a data-driven approach to marketing that focuses on growing a business by acquiring and retaining customers. 

It involves identifying and testing different marketing channels and tactics to determine which ones are most effective at driving growth. 

With the UX in dApps, we’d need to put our emphasis on some keywords here; 



* Acquiring and Retaining Customers
* Driving Growth

These two factors above are super essential for dApps built on Celo. While you focus on building awesome solutions etc, there’s the need to acquire dUAW - New users using your dApp - consistently.



<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image8.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert9">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![Growth Marketing Perspective of UX in dApps on Celo](docs\blog\05-05-2023-The-Importance-of-UX-in-Celo-DApps--A-Growth-Marketing-Perspective\Images\10.png)


Not Just Acquiring, but Retaining them, so they become repeat customers. 

Retaining the dUAW - the users - is the only way dApps on Celo can truly grow in terms of transaction volume, dUAW, Revenue, Market Share, Interactions and time spent on the dApp.

Here’s why, Rather than focusing solely on acquiring new customers, retention seeks to deepen the relationship with existing users and increase their loyalty to dApp.

Amongst many factors, the driving force behind increased retention is an amazing User Experience. One that keeps them glued to their screens and on the dApps you’ve built on Celo.

As you might have guessed, the focus on retention also ensures developers and marketers optimise their budget for Acquisition and drive scalable growth for the brand. 

That’s because they’ve got their retention on lock.

A not-so-great alternative to this is, do not to bother about UX on the dApps you build on Celo, careless about the Retention possibilities that could bring to the dApp you’ve built.

This would mean, you’d focus on spending huge revenue on acquiring new dUAW - users - because the previous ones that came simply left, and there’s no room for growth and scalability.
